abstract:
- content: This CCSDS Report presents a set of concepts, reference architecture, and
    service framework for spacecraft monitoring and control. The ability to standardize
    the interfaces for Spacecraft Monitoring and Control (SM&C) by means of a service
    oriented architecture will allow significant saving in the development of the
    flight components and the ground segment of future space missions. In fact, it
    will be possible to use standardized SM&C infrastructure systems to seamlessly
    transfer data across systems, and to adopt commercial-off-the-shelf applications
    for monitoring and control purposes.
