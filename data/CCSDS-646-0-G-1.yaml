abstract:
- content: This Informational Report establishes an evolving list of conventions used
    in the data generation process to produce real numbers.  These conventions are
    referenced in EAST Data Descriptions (see CCSDS 644.0-B-3) and could be referenced
    in other Data Description Records (DDRs), written in other Data Description Languages
    (DDL).  The CCSDS conducts periodic reconfirmation reviews of its publications
    to assure their continued relevance. This Informational Report has been reconfirmed
    through June 2022.
