- content: This Recommended Practice specifies a C++ Application Program Interface
    (API) for the CCSDS Space Link Extension Return All Frames Service (RAF) Service.  The
    API is intended for use by application programs implementing the SLE RAF Service.  The
    current issue updates text to be consistent with the current version of the SLE
    RAF service specification and differentiates applicability by SLE RAF service
    specification version.
