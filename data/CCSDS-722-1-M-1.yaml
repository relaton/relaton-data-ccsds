abstract:
- content: This CCSDS Recommended Practice specifies how to operate the CCSDS File
    Delivery Protocol (CFDP) over the CCSDS Encapsulation Service as provided for
    Earth-to-spacecraft, spacecraft-to-Earth, and spacecraft-to-spacecraft communications.
    It sets out the communications architecture for CFDP operating over the Encapsulation
    Service.  It describes the service expected by CFDP of the underlying layers and
    reconciles this with the service provided by the Encapsulation Service.
