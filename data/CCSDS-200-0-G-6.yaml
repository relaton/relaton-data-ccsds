abstract:
- content: In order to establish a common framework within which the Agencies may
    develop standardized telecommand services, the CCSDS advocates adoption of a layered
    systems architecture. Within this approach, specific layers of service (including
    their operational protocol and data structuring techniques) may be selected for
    implementation according to mission requirements. The current layered set of CCSDS
    telecommand Recommendations was developed to match the conventional free-flying
    mission environment, as characterized by the transmission of command data at relatively
    low uplink data rates to spacecraft of moderate complexity. This Report summarizes
    the principal concepts associated with the CCSDS recommended space mission telecommanding
    architecture.  This document has been reconfirmed by the CCSDS Management Council
    through October 2021.
