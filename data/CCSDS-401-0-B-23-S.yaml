abstract:
- content: Numerous concise recommendations appear in the notebook volume bearing
    the number 401.0-B.  Each recommendation is dated, and the most recent revision
    is shown in the table of contents.  These Recommendations are developed for conventional
    near-Earth and deep-space missions having moderate communications requirements.  The
    current issue updates recommendation 2.3.2A, deletes recommendation 3.3.3A, and
    corrects an error in recommendation 4.1.5.
