abstract:
- content: This Recommendation details Space Data System Standards in the area of
    Proximity space links.  Proximity space links are defined to be short-range, bi-directional,
    fixed or mobile radio links, generally used to communicate among probes, landers,
    rovers, orbiting constellations, and orbiting relays.  These links are characterized
    by short time delays, moderate (not weak) signals, and short, independent sessions.
