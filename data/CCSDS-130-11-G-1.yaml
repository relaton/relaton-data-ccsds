    It is expected that a number of Earth Exploration Satellite Service (EESS) missions will carry payloads producing substantial data rates, that is, starting from a few hundred Mb/s. Such missions would benefit from employing transmitters using a state-of-the-art air interface that exploits link adaption, that is, achieves high spectral efficiency by adjusting the modulation and coding to the link budget.
