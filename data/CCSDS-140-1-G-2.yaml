    This Informational Report identifies and describes the atmospheric
    constituents that are most responsible for transmission losses in optical
    communications links at wavelengths near 1550 and 1064 nm. Considerations
    concerning the temporal measurement of the atmospheric parameters are
    discussed, along with the possible ways the data can be used for long-term
    ETS characterization and real-time operations, including handover prediction
    support.
