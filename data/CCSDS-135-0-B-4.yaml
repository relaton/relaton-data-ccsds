abstract:
- content: 'The CCSDS Recommended Standard for Space Link Identifiers documents the
    identifiers that are defined or reserved by CCSDS as part of the specification
    of the CCSDS space link protocols, and it shows how these identifiers are managed
    at the CCSDS level. The current update removes identifiers for direct multiplexing
    of IPv4 datagrams in CCSDS frames and adds a new specification for CCSDS IP Extension. '
