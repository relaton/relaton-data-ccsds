    (API) for the CCSDS Space Link Extension Forward Space Packet (FSP) Service.  The
    API is intended for use by application programs implementing the SLE FSP Service.  The
    current issue updates text to be consistent with the current version of the SLE
    FSP service specification and differentiates applicability by SLE FSP service
    specification version.
