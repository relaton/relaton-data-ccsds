abstract:
- content: Numerous concise recommendations appear in the notebook volume bearing
    the number 401.0-B.  Each recommendation is dated, and the most recent revision
    is shown in the table of contents.  These Recommendations are developed for conventional
    near-Earth and deep-space missions having moderate communications requirements.  The
    current issue updates recommendations 2.1.4A and 2.1.4B, deletes recommendations
    2.1.8A and  2.1.8B, and adds new recommendation 2.6.11A.
