abstract:
- content: This Recommendation establishes a common framework and provides a common
    basis for the coding schemes used on spacecraft telemetry streams. The telemetry
    channel coding concept described is the baseline concept for spacecraft-to-ground
    data communication within missions that are cross supported between Agencies of
    the CCSDS. The current Issue adds Reed-Solomon interleaving depth 8 and clarifies
    text regarding use of the Pseudo-Randomizer.
