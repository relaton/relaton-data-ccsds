abstract:
- content: This Recommendation extends the previous set of CCSDS Recommendations for
    conventional missions to accommodate extra services needed by Advanced Orbiting
    Systems. Target Advanced Orbiting Systems include manned and man-tended space
    stations, unmanned space platforms, free-flying spacecraft, and new space transportation
    systems, many of which require a richer repertoire of data handling services than
    are provided by the conventional Recommendations. The current issue adds specifications
    that allow the CCSDS Version-2 Transfer Frame (AOS VCDU) to be used to transport
    other types of packets in addition to CCSDS Version-1 Packets (CP_PDUs), including
    CCSDS Network Protocol (NP) Packets and Internet Protocol (IP) packets.
