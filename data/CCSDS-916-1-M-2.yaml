- content: This Recommended Practice specifies a C++ Application Program Interface
    (API) for the CCSDS Space Link Extension Forward CLTU (FCLTU) Service.  The API
    is intended for use by application programs implementing the SLE FCLTU Service.  The
    current issue updates text to be consistent with the current version of the SLE
    FCLTU service specification and differentiates applicability by SLE FCLTU service
    specification version.
