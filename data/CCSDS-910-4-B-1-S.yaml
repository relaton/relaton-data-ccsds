abstract:
- content: This Recommendation establishes a common framework and provides a common
    basis for the specification of data services that extend the space-to-ground communication
    services previously defined by CCSDS. It allows implementing organizations within
    each agency to proceed coherently with the development of compatible derived standards
    for the ground systems that are within their cognizance.
