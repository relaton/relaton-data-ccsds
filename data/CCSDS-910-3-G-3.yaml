abstract:
- content: "This Report presents the cross support concept for CCSDS Space Link Extension
    (SLE) services.  It identifies the functional components of the ground-resident
    portion of a space data system and defines the interface points where agency interoperations
    may occur.  This Report summarizes the technical considerations for all cross
    support of CCSDS-compliant space data systems. \n\nThe CCSDS conducts periodic
    reconfirmation reviews of its publications to assure their continued relevance.
    \ This Informational Report has been reconfirmed through June 2022."
