abstract:
- content: The Command Operation Procedure forms a subpart of the Data Routing Service,
    which is described in CCSDS 202.0-B-3. This Recommendation contains the definition
    of the Command Operation Procedure in the form of state tables at the level of
    detail necessary to allow cross support. The current issue clarifies and improves
    the specification based on experience with real implementations.
