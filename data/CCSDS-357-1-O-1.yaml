    Certificate Authorities (CAs) are trusted third-party entities that create, issue, store, and sign digital certificates. These digital certificates are afforded both integrity and authentication by
    virtue of the CA digital signature on the certificate. As a result, the authentication and integrity of the information contained in the certificate is assured as long as the CA, and the root certificates they generate, are secure and uncompromised.
