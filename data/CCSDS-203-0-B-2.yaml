abstract:
- content: This Recommendation was developed within the layered architectural framework
    and embraces the standard data structures and data communication procedures that
    may be used by conventional missions within the highest telecommand layers. The
    current issue adds specifications that allow the CCSDS Version-1 Telecommand Transfer
    Frame to be used to transport other types of packets in addition to CCSDS Version-1
    Telecommand Packets, including CCSDS Network Protocol (NP) Packets and Internet
    Protocol (IP) packets. This enhanced functionality is added to the Transfer Frame
    through the introduction of a standardized approach to interpreting the packet
    version number field. The format of the Transfer Frame is not changed from the
    previous issue.
