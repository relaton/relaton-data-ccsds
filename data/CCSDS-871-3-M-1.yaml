abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice defines services and service interfaces provided
    by the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services Device Enumeration Service (DES),
    which provides management and user notification of addition of devices to or removal
    of devices from a spacecraft. The main goal of DES is to assist onboard reconfiguration
    functions, such as mode management or fault detection, isolation, and recovery
    regarding the notification of changes in the spacecraft configuration, and the
    execution of operations needed to adjust the onboard software to the new configuration.
