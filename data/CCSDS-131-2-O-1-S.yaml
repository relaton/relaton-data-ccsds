abstract:
- content: 'This Experimental Specification describes a new coding/modulation scheme
    that provides a wide range of spectral efficiency values that can be reconfigured
    without interrupting the data transfer over the physical channel.  The implementation
    of the encoder can be realized with certain degrees of parallelism without any
    significant increase in memory or computation requirements. This feature makes
    the scheme attractive in particular for on-board '
