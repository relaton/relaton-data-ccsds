abstract:
- content: "This CCSDS Informational Report presents a set of concepts and tutorial
    on the XML Telemetric and Command Exchange (XTCE). XTCE is an XML based format
    aim at facilitating the exchange of spacecraft telemetry and command databases
    between different organizations and systems during any mission phase. Such a non-proprietary
    format avoids the need for customized import/export tools, and the validation
    and new implementation of mission databases, which are often error-prone. The
    scope of XTCE is limited to the exchange of satellite telemetry and commanding
    databases. XTCE can be used to exchange a database between spacecraft manufacturers,
    instrument manufacturers, and different systems of the ground segment. It can
    also be used as an exchange mechanism between different development teams or between
    missions, which enhances database re-use. \n<br><br>\nThis document issue was
    superseded by CCSDS 660.2-G-2, XML \nTelemetric and Command Exchange (XTCE) (Green
    Book, Issue 2), released February 2021."
