abstract:
- content: "The CCSDS Recommended Standard for Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol—Coding
    and Synchronization Sublayer  specifies the synchronization and channel coding
    schemes used with the Proximity-1 Data Link Protocol.  The current issue includes
    several improvements and clarifications-accomplishing better alignment and consistency
    with the other Proximity-1 Blue Books—and the addition of an option for Low-Density
    Parity-Check (LDPC) codes.\n\nThis document issue was superseded by CCSDS \n211.2-B-3,
    Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol—Coding \nand Synchronization Sublayer (Blue Book,
    Issue 3, \nOctober 2019), released October 2019."
