abstract:
- content: This CCSDS Informational Report presents a set of concepts, reference architecture,
    and service framework for Spacecraft Monitoring and Control (SM&C).  The standardization
    of the SM&C interfaces by means  of a service-oriented architecture will allow
    development of  standardized SM&C infrastructure systems for seamless transfer
    of data across systems, and adoption of commercial-off-the-shelf applications
    for monitoring and control purposes.  The result will be  significant savings
    in the development of the flight components and the ground segment of future space
    missions.
