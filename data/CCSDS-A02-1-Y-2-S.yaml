abstract:
- content: This Restructured Organization and Processes document was initially created
    in response to calls to update and re-engineer the CCSDS organization at its autumn
    2002 meeting. As a result, "CCSDS RECORD A02.1-Y-1, PROPOSAL FOR RESTRUCTURING
    THE CCSDS ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES" was published in March 2003.  This document
    updates A02.1-Y-1 by removing the rationale that led to the reorganization (thus
    streamlining the new CCSDS working procedures), and also to clarify the differences
    between "Recommended Standard" and "Recommended Practice" on the Standards track.
