- content: This Report establishes a common framework and provides a common basis
    for the development of SLE services. It allows the development of compatible derived
    Standards for the SLE services that are within their cognizance. Derived Agency
    Standards may implement only a subset of the optional features allowed by the
    Cross Support Recommendations.
