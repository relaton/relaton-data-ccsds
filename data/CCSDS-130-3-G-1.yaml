abstract:
- content: 'This Report presents the concept and rationale of the CCSDS Packet Protocols,
    Space Packet Protocol (SPP) and Encapsulation Packet Protocol (EPP). It presents
    an overview of the concepts of SPP and EPP, it provides information on how these
    protocols should be applied for efficient development of mission systems (including
    onboard instruments and ground-support systems) and on how these protocols should
    be deployed in space data systems for efficient development of multi-mission infrastructures
    (including both onboard and ground infrastructures), and it describes the key
    distinctions between these protocols, so that both end users and developers have
    guidance in choice of protocol. '
