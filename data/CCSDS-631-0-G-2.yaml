abstract:
- content: This Report describes the Control Authority (CA) organization from both
    an implementer's and a user's perspective.  This document serves as a companion
    document to Control Authority Procedures (CAP), CCSDS 630.0-B-1, and Control Authority
    Data Structures (CADS), CCSDS 632.0-B-1, and as such is intended to provide a
    tutorial for the procedures and services identified in the CAP and CADS Recommended
    Standards, background to assist in the effective implementation of the CAP and
    CADS Recommended Standards, and rationale and requirements for the CA organization.  The
    CCSDS conducts periodic reconfirmation reviews of its publications to assure their
    continued relevance. This Informational Report has been reconfirmed through May
    2018.
