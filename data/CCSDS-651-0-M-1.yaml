- content: "This Recommended Practice identifies, defines, and provides structure
    \ to the relationships and interactions between an information Producer  and an
    Archive.  This Recommended Practice defines the methodology for the structure
    of actions that are required from the initial time of contact between the Producer

    the Archive. These actions cover the first stage of the Ingest Process as defined
    in the Open Information System (OAIS) Reference Model.  This Recommended Practice
    describes parts of the functional entities Administration ('Negotiate Submission
    Agreement') and Ingest ('Receive Submission' and 'Quality Assurance'). The CCSDS
    conducts periodic reconfirmation reviews of its publications to assure their continued
    relevance. \n\nThe CCSDS conducts periodic reconfirmation reviews of its publications
