abstract:
- content: The CCSDS PUBLICATIONS MANUAL defines a set of style specifications intended
    to standardize the appearance and format of CCSDS publications.  It is intended
    to serve as both a guide for CCSDS document developers and an editorial Manual
    for publishers of CCSDS Documents.  The current issue adds requirements indicated
    by CCSDS A02.1-Y-3, Organization and Processes for the Consultative Committee
    for Space Data Systems (Yellow Book, Issue 3, July 2011); eliminates obsolescent
    materials, e.g., materials having to do with offset printing; and eliminates some
    inconsistencies.
