abstract:
- content: This Recommendation establishes a common framework and provides a common
    basis for the data structures of spacecraft telemetry streams. The Packet Telemetry
    concept described is the baseline concept for spacecraft-to-ground data communication
    within missions that are cross supported between Agencies of the CCSDS. Issue
    5 of the CCSDS Packet Telemetry Recommendation adds specifications that allow
    the CCSDS Version-1 Telemetry Transfer Frame to be used to transport other types
    of packets in addition to CCSDS Version-1 Packets, including CCSDS Network Protocol
    (NP) Packets and Internet Protocol (IP) packets. This enhanced functionality is
    added to the Transfer Frame through the introduction of a standardized approach
    to interpreting the packet version number field. The format of the Transfer Frame
    is not changed from the previous issue.
