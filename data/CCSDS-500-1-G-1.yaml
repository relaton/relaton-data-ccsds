abstract:
- content: This Informational Report describes the theoretical aspects of and discusses
    trade-offs and system performance for the navigation technique known as Delta
    Differential One-Way Ranging (Delta-DOR).  The topics covered include a general
    description of the technique, theoretical background, definition of observables,
    estimates of system performance, system trade-offs, and descriptions of existing
    systems.  This Report deals explicitly with the technical definitions and conventions
    associated with inter-Agency cross-support situations involving Delta Differential
    One-way Ranging operations.
