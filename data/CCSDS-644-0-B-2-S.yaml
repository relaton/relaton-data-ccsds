abstract:
- content: This update to the original Data Description Language EAST Recommendation
    extends EAST ability to handle repeated data items where repetition is terminated
    by a marker. The previous specification allowed this only at the first level of
    data hierarchy. These updates allow it at any level in the data hierarchy.  This
    document has been reconfirmed by the CCSDS management Council through March 2011.
