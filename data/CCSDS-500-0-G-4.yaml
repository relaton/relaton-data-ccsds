abstract:
- content: This Report contains technical material to supplement the CCSDS Recommended
    Standards for spacecraft navigation data.  The topics covered include radiometric
    data content, spacecraft ephemeris, planetary ephemeris, tracking station locations,
    coordinate systems, and attitude data. This Report deals explicitly with the technical
    definitions and conventions associated with interagency cross-support situations
    involving the transfer of ephemeris, tracking, and attitude data.  The current
    issue brings the Green Book up to date with the current issue of Orbit Data Messages
    (CCSDS 502.0-B-2) as well as the new Recommended Standards for Tracking Data Message
    and Attitude Data Messages (CCSDS 503.0-B1 and CCSDS 504.0-B-1, respectively).
