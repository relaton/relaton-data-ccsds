abstract:
- content: This Recommendation was developed within the layered architectural framework
    and embraces the standard data structures and data communication procedures that
    may be used by conventional missions within the lowest telecommand system layers.
    In this update to CCSDS 201.0-B-2, codeblock length options have been eliminated
    in favor of a single standard length of 64 bits (the longest and most efficient
    of the options specified in the previous issues).
