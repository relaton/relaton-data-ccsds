abstract:
- content: This report examines Application Layer interoperability for missions using
    standards developed by the Mission Operations and Information Management Services
    (MOIMS) and the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS) Areas with a view
    to ensuring interactions are well-defined, well-understood, and unproblematic.  This
    report also provides a limited exploration of three different approaches to MOIMS
    and SOIS integration that may be adopted by different missions.
