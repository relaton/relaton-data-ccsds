abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice defines services and service interfaces provided
    by the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services Device Enumeration Service (DES),
    which provides management and user spacecraft. The main goal of DES is to assist
    onboard reconfiguration functions, such as mode management or fault detection,
    isolation, and recovery regarding the notification of changes in the spacecraft
    configuration, and the execution of operations needed to adjust the onboard software
    to the new configuration.
