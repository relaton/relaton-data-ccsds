abstract:
- content: This Recommendation for Telecommand Data Routing Service was developed
    within the layered architectural framework and embraces the standard data structures
    and data communication procedures that may be used by conventional missions within
    the intermediate telecommand system layers. The current issue adds specifications
    that allow the CCSDS Version-1 Telecommand Transfer Frame to be used to transport
    other types of packets in addition to CCSDS Version-1 Telecommand Packets, including
    CCSDS Network Protocol (NP) Packets and Internet Protocol (IP) packets. This enhanced
    functionality is added to the Transfer Frame through the introduction of a standardized
    approach to interpreting the packet version number field. The format of the Transfer
    Frame is not changed from the previous issue.
