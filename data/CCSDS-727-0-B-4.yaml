abstract:
- content: This  Recommended Standard defines a protocol suitable for the transmission
    of files to and from spacecraft data storage and capable of operating in a wide
    variety of mission configurations.  In addition to the purely file delivery related
    functions, the protocol includes file management services to allow control over
    the storage medium.  Although the protocol can operate over a wide range of subnetwork
    services, this  Recommended Standard assumes the use of existing CCSDS packet
    services.  The current issue incorporates corrections and clarifications recommended
    by the CFDP Interoperability Testing Working Group.
