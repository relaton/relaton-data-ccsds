abstract:
- content: "This Informational Report identifies and describes the atmospheric \nconstituents
    that are most responsible for transmission losses in \noptical communications
    links at wavelengths near 1550 and 1064 nm.  Considerations concerning the temporal
    measurement of the atmospheric parameters are discussed, along with the possible
    ways the data can be used for long-term ETS characterization and real-time operations,
    including handover prediction support."
