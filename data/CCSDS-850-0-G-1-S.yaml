abstract:
- content: This Informational Report describes the concept and supporting rationale
    for the Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services (SOIS).  It is intended to provide
    an introduction and overview of the SOIS services concept upon which the detailed
    CCSDS SOIS recommendations are based, as well as to summarize the specific individual
    service recommendations and rationale.  The concepts described in this Informational
    Report are the baseline concepts for the CCSDS standardization activities with
    respect to services and generic support services to be used in the flight segment
    of spacecraft systems.
