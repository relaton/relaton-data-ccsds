    This CCSDS Experimental Specification extends the existing CCSDS Recommended Standard for Flexible Advanced Coding and Modulation Scheme for High Rate Telemetry Applications (CCSDS 131.2-B-1, ), in order to add new Modulation and Coding (MODCODs) options, thereby increasing the range of operating conditions to higher signal-to-noise ratios.
