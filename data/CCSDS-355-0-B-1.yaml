The protocol provides a security header and trailer along with associated procedures that may be used with the CCSDS Telemetry, Telecommand, and Advanced Orbiting Systems Space Data Link Protocols to provide a structured method for applying data authentication and/or data confidentiality at the Data Link layer.
