abstract:
- content: This Informational Report contains background and explanatory material
    to support the CCSDS wireless network communications Best Practices for networked
    wireless communications in support of space missions.  It examines the possibilities
    and advantages of the onboard application of wireless communications technology
    to space missions, describes a set of driving use cases in the space domain, and
    evaluates the utilization of existing technologies and related terrestrial commercial
    standards to meet the resulting space-based use case requirements.  Also included
    is relevant tutorial information intended to assist the reader in understanding
    basic concepts of wireless transmission and networking along with possible issues
    related to the deployment of wireless networks.
