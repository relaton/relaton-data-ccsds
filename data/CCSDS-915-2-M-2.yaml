abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice specifies a C++ Application Program Interface
    (API) for the CCSDS Space Link Extension Return Channel Frames (RCF) Service.  The
    API is intended for use by application programs implementing the SLE RCF Service.
    The current issue updates text to be consistent with the current version of the
    SLE RCF service specification and differentiates applicability by SLE RCF service
    specification version.
