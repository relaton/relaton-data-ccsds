abstract:
- content: This Recommendation defines a protocol suitable for the transmission of
    files to and from spacecraft data storage and capable of operating in a wide variety
    of mission configurations. In addition to the purely file delivery related functions,
    the protocol includes file management services to allow control over the storage
    medium. Although the protocol can operate over a wide range of subnetwork services,
    this Recommendation assumes the use of existing CCSDS packet services.
