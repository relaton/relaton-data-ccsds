abstract:
- content: This Recommendation defines the services of a packet telemetry system.
    To do so, it establishes a layered model of Packet Telemetry protocols and defines
    Packet Telemetry Services by specifying the behavior at the service interfaces
    to each layer. The current issue adds specifications that allow the CCSDS Version-1
    Telemetry Transfer Frame to be used to transport other types of packets in addition
    to CCSDS Version-1 Packets, including CCSDS Network Protocol (NP) Packets and
    Internet Protocol (IP) packets. This enhanced functionality is added to the Transfer
    Frame through the introduction of a standardized approach to interpreting the
    packet version number field. The format of the Transfer Frame is not changed.
