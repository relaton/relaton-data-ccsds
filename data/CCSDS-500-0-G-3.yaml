abstract:
- content: This Report contains technical material to supplement the CCSDS Recommended
    Standards for spacecraft navigation data.  The topics covered include radiometric
    data content, spacecraft ephemeris, planetary ephemeris, tracking station locations,
    coordinate systems, and attitude data.  This Report deals explicitly with the
    technical definitions and conventions associated with interagency cross-support
    situations involving the transfer of ephemeris, tracking, and attitude data.  The
    current issue brings the Green Book up to date with the current issue of Orbit
    Data Messages (CCSDS 502.0-B-2) as well as the new Recommended Standards for Tracking
    Data Message and Attitude Data Messages (CCSDS 503.0-B1 and CCSDS 504.0-B-1, respectively).
