abstract:
- content: This Recommended Practice defines the procedures governing assignment,
    relinquishment, and management of CCSDS Spacecraft Identification (SCID) codes.  The
    current update adds frequency band as a qualifier for SCID assignment, names the
    SCID qualified by version number and frequency band the Qualified SCID (Q-SCID),
    and replaces the outdated hard-copy request form with instruction to use the online
    form on the Space Assigned Numbers Authority (SANA) Web site.  The current version
    of this document contains all updates through technical corrigendum 1, dated July
    2019.
