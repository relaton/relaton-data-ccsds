    Service (CSTS), which allows a spaceflight mission to receive cyclic reports on,
    and to query the current values of, the parameters that are pertinent to cross
    support services being provided by a Cross Support Complex. The Monitored Data
    service also allows a spaceflight mission to receive notifications of the occurrence
    of events of interest associated with the services that are being provided by
    a Cross Support Complex.\n<br><br>\nThis document issue was superseded by CCSDS
    922.1-B-2, Cross Support Transfer Services\x97Monitored Data Service (Blue Book,
