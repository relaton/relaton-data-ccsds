abstract:
- content: "This Informational Report concerns space data systems operations with
    Standard Formatted Data Units (SFDUs).  It explains the rationale for operations
    with SFDUs, the initial operational requirements for SFDUs, and the major benefits
    to be expected from operations with SFDUs.  The CCSDS conducts periodic reconfirmation
    reviews of its publications to assure their continued relevance.  \n\nThis document
    has been reconfirmed by the CCSDS Management Council through June 2024."
