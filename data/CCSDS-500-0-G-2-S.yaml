abstract:
- content: This Report contains technical material to supplement the CCSDS Recommendations
    for the standardization of spacecraft navigation data generated by CCSDS Member
    Agencies. The topics covered herein include radiometric data content, spacecraft
    ephemeris, planetary ephemeris, tracking station locations, coordinate systems,
    and attitude data. This Report deals explicitly with the technical definitions
    and conventions associated with inter-Agency cross-support situations involving
    the transfer of ephemeris, tracking, and attitude data.  The current issue contains
    expanded material regarding spacecraft attitude data and radiometric tracking
    data.
